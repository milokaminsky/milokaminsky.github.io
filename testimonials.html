			<blockquote class="testimonials floatleft">
				<p>&quot;I&#39;ve had the pleasure of working with Ian Millman over the past six years in numerous baseball endeavors, such as the Miami Marlins Scout Team and the NY Nine, amongst others. Ian has both a passion and knowledge for the game that is second to none. What separates Ian from most, is his commitment to helping student athletes excel both on the baseball field as wells as the classroom. He constantly stresses the importance of academics, as well as being an overall great person, not just a great baseball player.</p>

				<p>As a professional scout, Ian is an outstanding evaluator of talent. He is able to communicate effectively to each student athlete on what it takes to get to the next level. Because of his connections in the game, Ian has had numerous college coaches, area scouts, and national cross checkers down to games to evaluate his players. He genuinely wants to see his players succeed more than anything.</p>

				<p>Ian has a tireless work ethic and continually gives his time and effort to help other people get opportunities. He is a true ambassador to the game of baseball.&quot;</p>
